# INSPIRATION ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72274851/218500470-ec078b99-0a50-4b06-a2df-c09e47ecc187.png)

According to the UN, nearly half of all fruit and vegetables produced globally are wasted each year, leading to a significant waste of resources and energy. In light of this, the inspiration for a crop prediction machine learning model is to promote better yields among farmers and to combat malnutrition among people and animals. By leveraging advanced technology and data analysis, this project aims to optimize crop production and reduce waste, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient food system for all. With this model, farmers can make informed decisions about their crops, leading to increased yields and a reduced need for excessive use of resources such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides. Ultimately, this project has the potential to play a significant role in improving food security and reducing hunger on a global scale.

The crop recommendation application is a cutting-edge tool that helps farmers make informed decisions about what crops to grow. The application leverages machine learning algorithms to provide customized crop recommendations based on the soil data provided by the user. By inputting soil data such as pH levels, nutrient content, and soil moisture levels, the application can predict which crops are best suited to the user's soil conditions. This information can help farmers avoid wasting resources and time on crops that are unlikely to thrive, and instead focus on those that are best suited to their land. The application takes into account various factors such as regional climate, weather patterns, and historical crop yields to make its predictions. This information, along with the soil data provided by the user, enables the application to provide accurate and tailored crop recommendations that can help farmers maximize their yields and increase their profits. The crop recommendation application is a valuable tool for farmers looking to optimize their crop production and make the most of their land.

✅Building application using intel oneDAL:The Intel oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) contributes to the acceleration of big data analysis by providing highly optimised algorithmic building blocks for all phases of data analytics (preprocessing, transformation, analysis, modelling, validation, and decision making) in batch, online, and distributed processing modes of computation.The library optimizes data ingestion along with algorithmic computation to increase throughput and scalability.

✅Building a crop recommendation application involves a significant amount of research and development. During the process, I likely learned a number of things, including:

✅Soil Science: I likely gained a deeper understanding of soil science and the various factors that affect crop growth, such as pH levels, nutrient content, and soil moisture levels.

✅Machine Learning: I likely learned about different machine learning algorithms and how they can be applied to predict crop yields and make recommendations for farmers.

✅Data Analysis: I likely gained experience in collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, including historical crop yield data and soil data, to train our machine learning models.

✅Agricultural Trends: I likely gained insight into current trends in agriculture and the challenges facing farmers, such as the need for sustainable and efficient crop production.

✅Collaboration: Building a project like this likely required collaboration with a team of experts in various fields, such as soil science, machine learning, and data analysis, and I likely learned the importance of working together to achieve common goals.

These are just a few examples of the knowledge and skills that i likely gained while building this project. 
Overall, building a crop recommendation application is a challenging and rewarding experience that requires a combination of technical expertise and agricultural knowledge.
